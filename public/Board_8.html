                        <h5>Standard American Critique</h5>
                        <p>The outcome was determined entirely by a catastrophic failure in the auction. West/East attempted to play in 2H, but failed by 4 tricks, winning only 4 tricks against the required 8. The N/S partnership held the vast majority of the high cards (32 HCP total, N/S having 23 HCP). The key error was North's initial pass with 16 HCP and a balanced 3-3-4-3 hand after West opened 1D. This allowed the W/E partnership (17 HCP combined) to continue bidding unchallenged by the stronger side. East's 1H response with only 1 HCP was also highly non-standard and contributed to the confusion. The final contract of 2H by East was hopeless, as N/S had clear control of the auction and should have been playing in 3NT or 4H/4S.</p>

                                North missed the standard 1NT opening bid (15-17 HCP, balanced) or a Takeout Double over 1D. Had North correctly entered the auction, the strength of the N/S hands would have become apparent immediately. The W/E partnership lacks the strength for sophisticated bidding (like Splinters or Cue Bids) and the play was a straightforward defense by N/S, making advanced declarer techniques unnecessary and impossible to execute successfully.

                        <p>You must always enter the auction with 12 or more HCP, regardless of your position, unless you are faced with a prohibitive preemptive bid. North, holding 16 HCP, should have opened 1NT or made a Takeout Double over 1D. By passing, North violated the fundamental principle of competing for the contract when holding the strength. Failing to bid with a strong hand is a guaranteed way to miss slam or game opportunities, or, as demonstrated here, allow the opponents to play a low contract against which the defense is easy, even when your side holds the balance of power.</p>
