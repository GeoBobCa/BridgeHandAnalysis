A jump shift (2H) typically implies a stronger hand (12+ HCP or highly distributional) and is forcing. South's 3C rebid was descriptive of a minimum 4=4 minor hand, denying Heart support. While North correctly passed 3C based on the combined 23 HCP (insufficient for game), the choice of 3C as the final contract was unfortunate, leading to a massive loss.",

However, given the balanced nature of the hand and the presence of stoppers (AQ in Clubs, KQT8 in Diamonds), 2NT would have been a superior rebid over 3C, even if it meant skipping the minor suit fit. 2NT is often preferred over a minor suit partial when the hand is balanced and game is unlikely, as it utilizes the combined strength better.
