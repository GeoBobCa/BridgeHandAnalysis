Since West is 22 HCP, 2N is the most descriptive rebid, limiting the hand immediately. The actual auction saw West bid 3H, which is acceptable but less precise. Once East confirms minimum values (5 HCP), West correctly stops at 3N. Slam is impossible (27 total HCP). The double dummy truth confirms 3N is the maximum achievable contract for the East/West partnership.",
