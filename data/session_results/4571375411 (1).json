Since West is too strong for a simple 2N (16-18) or 3N (19-21) rebid, showing the 5-card major (3H) is the most accurate way to describe the hand shape while maintaining the game force. The partnership correctly identified that despite East's 6-card Spade suit, the combined strength (27 TP) and West's balanced nature meant 3N was a safer and higher-percentage contract than a major suit game. Double dummy confirms 3N is the only game that makes.",
