The standard approach suggests East bids 2S (Limit Raise, 10-12+ points), showing support but inviting game. West, holding minimum values (12 TP) and no defensive controls in the critical suits, must pass 2S. The optimal safe contract is 2S, although even 2S may be in danger due to the opponent's immediate 6 winners.",
