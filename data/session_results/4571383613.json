East holds 14 TP and 3-card support, placing the partnership comfortably into game range (26 TP combined) with possible slam potential. East's immediate jump to 4S shuts down all investigation. Standard SAYC procedure requires a game-forcing response to fully explore the hands. The best standard approach for a strong hand with support is often the 2NT artificial game-forcing response, asking opener to describe their hand further.",

Given West's minimal strength (12 TP) revealed through the forcing sequence, slam (6S) would be too optimistic, relying heavily on perfect splits or a successful heart play against the opposing AQ/T. Therefore, 4S is the correct final contract, and the advanced sequence mirrors the basic structure for confirmation.",
