When opponents jump aggressively to game (4S) despite visible weakness (especially after a minimum opening), the player with strong defensive suits, like South's AKQTx of Clubs, must utilize a penalty double. This indicates confidence in defeating the contract by at least two tricks and is highly recommended here, as 4S is a sure fire failure.",
