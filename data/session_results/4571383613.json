The correct sequence involves 1NT, followed by competitive bidding. West's subsequent 2D bid after South's 2C overcall accurately describes the 5-5 shape. East, knowing West is minimum (10-12) and has two suits, correctly invites 3NT via 2NT, recognizing that 3NT is the most likely game target if West has maximum values. Since West is minimum, stopping in 2NT is correct, minimizing the loss compared to 4S.",
