After a competitive overcall (1S) and a constructive raise (2D), East must evaluate the partnership's defensive structure against Spades and the overall point count. With 18 HCP and knowing West has 7-10, game is certain. Bypassing 3D (which might be interpreted as invitational or forcing to game depending on style, but often implies a desire to play in the suit) for 3NT shows confidence in stoppers and a preference for the higher-scoring NT game, especially given the 4-4 major suit distribution in the E/W hands. The DD truth confirms 3NT makes 11 tricks, validating this aggressive game decision.",
