West responded with 2D, a constructive raise showing 3+ card Diamond support and 7-10 HCP. With 18 HCP and partner promising 7-10 HCP (25-28 combined), East correctly recognized game potential.

Since East holds excellent controls (A in Clubs, AK in Diamonds, KJT in Hearts, QJ in Spades), the priority shifts from exploring the minor suit fit to securing the higher-scoring NT game.
