After the takeout double and the minimum 1S response, South must use a forcing or highly invitational bid to describe the hand accurately. Bidding 2C is a constructive rebid showing a strong 5-card suit and promising extra values (15+ points). This allows the partnership to find the superior 3C contract, which benefits from the cross-ruffing potential enabled by South's singleton Heart and the strong Club suit. Although N/S only hold 6 Clubs, the DD analysis confirms 10 tricks are available, highlighting the importance of distribution over raw card count in this specific layout.",
