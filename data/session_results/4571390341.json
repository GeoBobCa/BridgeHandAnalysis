The critical error occurred when West passed the double; West must rebid 2H, showing a minimum 5-card suit and asking partner to bid. Following the actual auction path where West passed, South, knowing the strong hand and finding a 4-4 fit in spades, should have bid 3S (strong invitation) or 4S (to play) immediately, as the combined TP (23) coupled with the excellent control and distribution (singleton Heart, running Clubs) makes 4S highly likely.",

However, given North's weakness, 4S is simply a high-probability contract based on playing trick analysis: 5 Club tricks, 4 Spade tricks, and 1 Diamond Ace yields 10 tricks, making 4S highly secure. South's hand is so powerful distributionally that the 23 combined points play like 26.",
