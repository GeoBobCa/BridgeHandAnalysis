Assuming East provides the necessary 5 HCP for distribution, West can count 12 tricks off the top (5 Hearts, 4 Diamonds, 2 Clubs, 1 Spade King) before considering East\u2019s contribution. The objective must be to confirm all key controls (Aces and Kings) are held, leading to 7NT.",

After West shows 2NT (22-24 balanced) or 2H (showing a 5-card suit and forcing), 4NT can be employed immediately. Given West holds five Key Cards themselves (A, K of Clubs; A, K, Q of Hearts; K, Q of Diamonds; K of Spades), the grand slam is guaranteed. West only needs to ensure the partnership owns all four Aces. Assuming East's 2D response shows 0-7 HCP, West can still bid 7NT based on known top winners.",
