West then described their suit and shape with 3 Hearts (5+ card suit, 22+ HCP). At this point, West knows game is certain. East, having no good Heart support and recognizing the high point count, opted for 3 No-Trump. West, knowing they have 10 playing tricks (4H, 2C, 3D, 1S), should have invited slam or bid 4NT, rather than passing 3NT. The recommended goal contract is 4NT.",
