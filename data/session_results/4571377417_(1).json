      "North (13 HCP) erred significantly by bidding 3C (natural and preemptive) over West's 2H opener. The standard, constructive action is a Takeout Double, which efficiently describes North's values and shape, potentially leading to an NS game contract.",
      "West's initial 2H opening was too strong (11 HCP) for a textbook Weak Two, which typically ranges from 6-10 HCP. While aggressive, it led to a high contract that was likely successful for EW.",

North's 13 HCP and 4=1=3=5 distribution clearly warranted a Double rather than a natural, low-level preempt in a minor (3C). The Double would allow NS to compete effectively and potentially find their own game.",
