The most logical game target, 3NT, fails by one trick (8 tricks), but the partnership should have aimed for it. Stopping in 3C, which fails by two tricks, was a major missed opportunity.",

Since 4S is unbiddable using standard methods, the partnership should focus on the most logical game, 3NT. North's decision to bid 3C over 2H was a failure of evaluation. North has excellent controls (AKJ in Clubs, QT in Spades, QJT in Diamonds) and should recognize the combined strength. Bidding 2NT is crucial here to describe the hand accurately (minimum opener, stopper, no major fit) and allow the 11 HCP responder to push to game. The actual 3C contract is a poor choice, as the Club suit is vulnerable to the 10 and 9 in East/West hands, leading to quick losers.",
