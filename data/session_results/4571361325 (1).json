A jump shift over an opponent's overcall is highly constructive, often implying a strong hand (10+ points) and a good suit, sometimes forcing to game. North, holding a minimum 14 HCP, should have recognized the game potential after South's strong bid. North's subsequent 3C bid was a premature attempt to settle the contract in a minor suit, ignoring the implied 4-4 major fit. A better approach for North after 1C - (1S) - 2H would be a cue-bid of 2S (asking for a stopper or showing interest in game) or 2NT, allowing South to accurately place the final contract based on their shape and controls.",
