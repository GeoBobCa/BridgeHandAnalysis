South's maximum negative hand is highly valuable here, providing two essential outside Kings (KD, KH) and robust trump support. The slam line relies on using the Diamond singleton (A) in North as an entry to ruff subsequent Diamonds in South\u2019s hand, establishing 13 total tricks without relying on an immediate Heart finesse (though 4H cuebidding often helps place the Ace). The 3D cuebid by South is crucial as it shows the King of Diamonds is correctly placed for slam development.",
