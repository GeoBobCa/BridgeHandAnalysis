East's 11 HCP hand with Kx in Hearts does not meet this requirement, risking a misjudged game try by West. West's 2NT rebid was a standard game invitation based on the strength promised by East. Since the partnership has 25 HCP, 2NT is a reasonable invite, and East's subsequent pass was correct, recognizing the lack of high card strength needed for 3NT.",
