North's 1S rebid is standard 'up the line' bidding, showing 4 Spades and 4 Diamonds. South must recognize that while 1S is a 4-4 fit, 1H was bid first and is equally a 4-4 fit. With 9 HCP, South's hand is too strong to pass 1S, especially when 1S is a poor contract. Bidding 2H is a constructive preference bid, showing 4-card support for the suit South originally responded in, and inviting partner to play there. This avoids the failing 1S contract and aims for the better fit, 2H (which fails by only one trick, compared to 1S failing by three).",
