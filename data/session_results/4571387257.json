However, following the actual auction where North opened 1D and subsequently rebid 1S (confirming a 4-4 Spade fit), South has a clear responsibility to describe their hand strength. With 9 HCP and established support, South must make a Limit Raise (2S), inviting North to continue to game if North is max-range (13-14 HCP). Since North holds a minimum 12 HCP, North should decline the invitation, resulting in the correct part score contract of 2S.",
