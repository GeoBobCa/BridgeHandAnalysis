      "South's initial pass with 9 HCP and a 4=4=3=2 distribution was too cautious. Borderline hands should typically be opened by the dealer to simplify finding a major suit fit later.",

      "North, holding 12 HCP and knowing they had a 4-4 major fit, should have continued bidding to at least 2S (or 3S) after South passed 1S, as the overall strength easily supports a higher contract."

South should open the bidding, preferably 1H (showing the 4-card major) or 1D. North responds 1S, showing 4+ Spades and 6+ HCP. South then raises to 2S to show the fit and minimum opening values (9-11 HCP). North's hand (12 HCP) is strong enough to invite 3S, which South, having shown a minimum, should pass.",
