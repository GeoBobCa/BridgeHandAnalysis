The void Diamond requires partnership discussion, perhaps using cue bids if strong enough, but here, the lack of sufficient combined HCP (even counting distributional points, the total is marginal for game) and the immediate threat of a Diamond run makes 3NT a non-starter. No specialized advanced conventions were required; the issue was one of fundamental valuation and safety.",
