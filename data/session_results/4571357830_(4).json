West holds 9 HCP and 3-card Diamond support, which is suitable for a constructive raise to 2D (Limit Raise, 6-9 HCP). Knowing they have a combined minimum of 27 HCP (18 + 9), and seeing the running Diamond suit (AKT53 opposite Q82), East correctly recognizes the assured 3NT game and jumps directly. 3NT is the optimal contract and makes easily, primarily relying on the Diamond suit for source tricks.",
