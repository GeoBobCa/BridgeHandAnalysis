When East raised to 3H, North should have passed, allowing E/W to play 3H, which DDS confirms goes down 3 tricks (+150 to N/S).

The 3C jump is highly preemptive and fails to describe the hand accurately. The final 4H bid by North is a competitive error, likely intended as a sacrifice or a penalty double that was misapplied. Since N/S make 9 tricks in Hearts, they are down 1 in 4H. Had N/S found their 8-card minor fits (Clubs or Diamonds), game was still unreachable, but 2S (8 tricks) or 3C (7 tricks) would have been better contracts if they insisted on bidding. However, the best result was achieved by defending 3H.",
