North's 3C bid was highly informative, indicating N/S had sufficient values (20 combined HCP) to compete or defend strongly. West failed to heed this warning. The optimal result for N/S would have been to double 4H for a penalty (+300), or play 3H/4S (which are non-making but better than E/W's 4H). Stopping at 3H (down 5) or 4H (down 3) are both poor results for E/W, but 4H is the more aggressive and costly mistake.",
