North's 9 HCP hand, featuring a 5-card major and good controls (A, Q, J), plays stronger than a flat minimum. When Opener rebids 1NT, Responder must evaluate whether Opener is likely to be 12 HCP or 14 HCP. Since 3NT makes, North should have stretched to invite game, recognizing that 23 combined points is often sufficient for 3NT, especially when the hand shapes complement each other well (5-card club suit opposite a 5-card spade suit, and good controls in the side suits).",
