This allows South to use 3S as a constructive bid showing minimum support. North then uses the Quantitative 4NT bid, which is highly effective when the opener has a known massive point count (23 HCP) and is looking for partner to confirm maximum minimum values (6-7 HCP). Since South has 6 HCP, passing 4NT is correct, but North, knowing the total 29 HCP and the excellent distribution (singleton Ace of Diamonds), can confidently bid 6NT, which makes 12 tricks.",
