Once North defines the hand as 22-24 balanced via the 2NT rebid, South's 4NT quantitative bid is highly effective. South's 6 HCP, while low, provides enough support and controls (King of Hearts, King of Diamonds) to justify the slam try. North, holding 23 HCP, should always accept the quantitative invitation, leading to the optimal 6NT contract. Given the double dummy truth, 7NT is also possible, but 6NT is the safer, standard slam target here.",
