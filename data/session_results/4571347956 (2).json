After South's negative 2H response, North's 2NT rebid is crucial, defining the strength and shape (22-24 semi-balanced). South must then cooperate by describing features. South's 3D shows the Diamond King, which is vital as North is singleton Diamond. North then uses 4NT quantitatively, recognizing that 6NT is the superior contract (12 tricks) over 6S (10 tricks) due to the excellent side suits and the potential for club establishment. South's acceptance of the quantitative bid with 6NT is correct given the maximum 6 HCP and the known fit/controls.",
