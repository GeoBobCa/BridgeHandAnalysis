North must continue to push towards game. After South's 1H response, North's aggressive rebid of 2S (showing four spades and forcing/highly invitational values) encourages South. South, with a maximum 7 points and a Spade fit, should accept the invitation by bidding 3S. North should then confidently bid 4S, which makes comfortably (expected 10 tricks, potentially 11).",
