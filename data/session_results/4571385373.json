South, having already shown 6+ points, is obligated to bid again, even if they have minimum values. Passing 1S is a technical error that prematurely ends the auction. North, with 18 HCP, should have considered a stronger rebid like 2C to better convey strength and force game exploration, but 1S was the most direct way to find the 4-4 Spade fit. Once the 4-4 fit is confirmed at 2S, North correctly passes, recognizing that 24 total points combined with poor distribution limits the trick-taking potential to 8 tricks.",
