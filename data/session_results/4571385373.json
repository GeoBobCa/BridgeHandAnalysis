While North could have rebid 2NT to show a balanced 18-19, bidding 1S immediately finds the 4-4 major fit, which is often paramount in competitive auctions. South's 1H bid was a standard competitive response, showing shape. The key advanced concept here is recognizing the limitations of the combined hands (24 HCP but poor controls and distribution) and correctly judging that 2S is too high, despite finding the fit. The double dummy truth confirms that 1S making 8 tricks is the maximum achievable part-score in spades.",
