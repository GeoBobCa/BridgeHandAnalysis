North opened 1C and then faced two intermediate bids (1D/1H). To show the 16+ HCP strength and the 4-card Spade suit, North must make a strong rebid. A Reverse (1C followed by 2S) or a 2NT rebid showing 18-19 balanced is required to start the game investigation. Once North forces the auction, South confirms the fit and values, leading easily to 4S.",
