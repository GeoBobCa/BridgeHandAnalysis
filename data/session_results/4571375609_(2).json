This bid is directional, suggesting a minimum hand and asking partner (North) to judge. North holds 11 HCP and now recognizes the established 8-card Club fit and 23 combined HCP. This is a standard requirement for a minor suit game. North must ignore the defensive pass by East and bid 4C.",

South's 3C rebid simply describes the minimum hand (12-14 HCP) and four-card Club support. Since the partnership is forced to game and 4C is the best fit (8 cards) and easiest denomination to confirm, North bids 4C directly over 3C. While 4H is also viable (7-card fit, better quality trumps), the 8-card Club fit offers greater safety for the forced game.",
