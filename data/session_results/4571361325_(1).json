North, holding 15 TP and a good five-card club suit, must recognize that 5C is reachable. The 3C rebid used in the actual auction was too passive and limited the hand. North should have used a forcing sequence, such as jumping directly to 4C to invite 5C, or using a control bid if applicable, forcing partner to continue until game is reached.",

Since 3NT lacked certain spade stopping stability, the focus should immediately shift to the minor suit game, 5C. North's jump to 4C confirms the suit, shows strong game interest, and mandates South continue to 5C with a good maximum response (which South holds). No complex advanced conventions (like Splinters or RKCB) are required here; bidding judgment suffices.",
