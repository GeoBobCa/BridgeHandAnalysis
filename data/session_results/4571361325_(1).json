However, given the balanced nature of both hands (South 2=4=4=3, North 3=2=3=5) and good stoppers in all suits, 3NT is the optimal game contract and superior to 4C. North should use 1NT to describe their 12-14 balanced hand after South's 1C opening. South then searches for a major fit with 2D before accepting 3NT.",

North's 2H bid severely violates system agreements concerning suit quality and length needed for two-level responses, particularly reverses. Even if playing 2/1 Game Forcing, a response bid at the two-level guarantees at least 4 cards in the suit named. Adhering strictly to length requirements prevents this type of chaotic miscommunication.",
