North holds a massive 19 HCP with four Aces and an excellent fit. With such a powerful hand, North must cue-bid to investigate slam. North should cue the lowest available first-round control (Aces or King of a suit) before using Blackwood. Starting with 4C shows the Club Ace and asks South to describe their controls.",

After cue-bidding 4C and 4H, North uses 4NT to ask for Key Cards (four Aces + Trump King). South responds 5D (showing 1 or 4 key cards, typically 1 key card in 1430 RKCB conventions). North, knowing partner has QJ in trump and the KQT of Hearts, concludes that 6S is safe, as only two losers remain (and these may be reducible via good play or favorable layout).",
