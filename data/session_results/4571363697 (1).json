While 4D is usually sought with a fit, 3NT is often a better contract when the combined HCP is 25+ and the hands are relatively balanced, as is the case here.

After 1D - 1H - 1S - 2D, North has a clear picture: 23-26 total points, a Diamond fit, and potential weakness in Hearts (North is singleton Q). However, South's 1H response provides some comfort. Since the Diamond suit lacks high card strength (AKJ5 opposite Q983), relying on high cards for tricks in NT is safer than relying on ruffing values in a minor suit game. The DDT confirms 3NT makes 9 tricks, while 4D fails. North correctly identified the strength range but failed to prioritize the superior NT contract over the minor suit fit.",
