North must recognize that even if South is minimum (6 HCP), 22 combined points is enough for 3NT when the distribution is balanced (4=1=4=4 opposite 2=4=4=3). The failure to bid 3NT here is a common error of focusing too much on the minor suit fit (which is poor at 4-4) instead of the overall point count and balanced shape, which dictates NT game.",
