      "The partnership settled prematurely. They failed to fully investigate the strength and potential fit, resulting in a low-level contract when 3NT or possibly 4S were viable options.",
      "South's 1NT rebid, while technically correct (12-14 HCP, denying 4 Spades), undersold the overall potential of the hand, particularly the strong 5-card Club suit, which might have led North to investigate further."

Since the partnership holds 23 HCP, game is highly likely. North must use 2NT to invite game, promising 8-10 points. South, having a maximum 14 HCP, accepts the invitation by bidding 3NT, the most likely resting place.",

If South uses 2C (a rebid of the suit, showing 13-16 HCP and good clubs) instead of 1NT, it gives North space to confirm the 5-card suit with 2S (8-9 HCP), allowing South to jump directly to the likely winning 4S contract based on distribution and high card strength.",
