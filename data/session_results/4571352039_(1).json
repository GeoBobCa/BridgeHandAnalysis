If opponents lead and run four diamond tricks immediately, 3NT will fail. However, standard Bridge theory mandates aiming for game with 25 combined points, and the defensive risk must be accepted. South has a borderline hand for 1NT rebid being 5-3-3-2 unbalanced, but since no natural rebid exists at a low level, 1NT is the most descriptive. The advanced approach confirms that North's 2NT invitation is the key structural bid necessary to reach the correct contract.",
