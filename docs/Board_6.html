                        <p>The final contract was 3 Clubs by East, which was successfully made exactly for 9 tricks. This is a Part-Score contract, stopping short of Game (5C). The East-West partnership has 25 combined HCP, which suggests a potential game might exist, but given the actual trick count achievable (9 tricks), 3C was the optimal resting place.

The auction was disrupted by poor bidding discipline. West opened 1C (14 HCP, 5 cards). South made an overly aggressive 1S overcall on only 3 cards. West then made a critical error by bidding 2H. A Reverse bid (low suit, then higher suit at the 2-level) promises 16+ HCP and good shape, usually 5-4 or better. West had only 14 HCP and a 5-2 shape, fundamentally misrepresenting their strength and distribution. East correctly ignored the false strength signal and offered a simple constructive raise to 3C (11 HCP, 3-card support), which was enough to conclude the auction safely, preventing a disastrous attempt at 5C.</p>

                                The major error was West's misuse of the Reverse (2H). West should have rebid 2C to show a minimum opening hand (12-14 HCP) with a good 5-card club suit, or potentially bid 1NT (though 5-2-3-3 shape is slightly unbalanced). Given the actual distribution and N/S defense, 9 tricks were the maximum available. No advanced play technique like a Squeeze or Endplay was applicable, as the tricks were largely dictated by high card winners and the trump suit length.

                        <p>A Reverse bid (e.g., 1C then 2H) is an artificial forcing bid requiring specific minimum strength (usually 16+ HCP) and shape (usually a 5-card opening suit followed by a 4-card suit higher ranking than the first bid suit). If you do not have the required 16+ HCP, you must find a more conservative rebid, such as simply rebidding your original suit at the 2-level (2C), or bidding 1NT if balanced. West's 2H bid with only 14 HCP and a 2-card Heart suit was misleading, risking an unwarranted Game attempt by partner.</p>
